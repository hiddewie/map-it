# Cartography

Choices have been made for this project that influence the output map. An incomplete list of assumptions is documented here, which influenced these choices.

### Usage asumptions

- The map will be printed on paper.
- The map will be used primarily for travelling on a bicycle, although other means of transport may also find the map useful. 
- The map is sufficient to navigate around a foreign country for long periods, without other information.
- The map should be usable in urban and non-urban terrain.
- The map will be used for finding places to stay overnight with a tent (campings).
- The map will be used for finding supermarkets and shops to buy food.
- The map will be used for finding public transport stations.

### Cartography choices

- A great level of detail is being rendered, at just-readable sizes
- Only a small number of amenities are being rendered, with campings and then supermarkets being the most important. Places of warship, power lines and towers are rendered for orientation purposes.
- The names of every place up to hamlets are rendered to allow finding those places on way signs.
